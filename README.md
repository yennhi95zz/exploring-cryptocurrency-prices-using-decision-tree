# Exploring Cryptocurrency Prices using Decision Trees: A Guide using Bitcoin Historical Data 

## Introduction:
Cryptocurrencies have gained immense popularity in recent years, with Bitcoin being one of the most well-known digital currencies. Understanding the historical trends and patterns of cryptocurrency prices is crucial for investors and traders. In this project, we explore how to use Decision Trees to analyze cryptocurrency prices using the [Bitcoin Historical Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) dataset from Kaggle.

## Getting Started:
To run this project, follow the steps below:

- Clone the repository from GitHub:
`git clone https://github.com/your_username/Exploring-Cryptocurrency-Prices-using-Decision-Trees.git`

- Install the required packages:
`pip install pandas scikit-learn graphviz matplotlib`

- Import the dataset:

The Bitcoin Historical Data dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle and should be saved as 'bitstampUSD_1-min_data_2012-01-01_to_2021-03-31.csv' in the same directory as the project.

- Run the Jupyter notebook:

Open the Jupyter notebook 'Exploring Cryptocurrency Prices using Decision Trees.ipynb' and run each cell to execute the code.

- Code Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Importing the Dataset
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
4. Feature Engineering
5. Creating the Decision Tree Model
6. Evaluating the Model
7. Visualizing the Decision Tree
8. Conclusion

## Conclusion:

In this project, we explored how to use Decision Trees to analyze the price trends of Bitcoin using the Bitcoin Historical Data dataset from Kaggle. We covered the steps from importing the dataset to evaluating the model's performance and visualizing the Decision Tree. Based on the analysis, the Decision Tree model can be used to predict the price change of Bitcoin with a Mean Absolute Error of around 0.08%. We can use this model to make investment decisions or to build a trading strategy. It is important to note that the performance of the model may change over time, and it may not be accurate in predicting extreme market events or unexpected news. Therefore, it is recommended to continuously monitor the performance of the model and adjust investment decisions accordingly.
